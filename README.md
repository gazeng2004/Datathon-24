# Dublin Demand-Supply Decoder
## Welcome!
This is a data science project that looks at Airbnb searches in Dublin! Here we explore and figure out prominent trends that lead to high booking and better hosts!

## To Get Started
Feel free to take a look into our thought processes and results in the notebook
